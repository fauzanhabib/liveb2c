		# The ServerName directive sets the request scheme, hostname and port that

		# specifies what hostname must appear in the request's Host: header to
		# match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
		# value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.
		# However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

		 #   when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
